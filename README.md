  ## Description
  In this project, I use JavaScript to create a coding quiz. The application has a start button that initiates the quiz. A time starts counting down. If you get a question wrong, you loose 10 seconds from your countdown. If you get the answer right, you gain a point. At the end of the quiz you are presented with a text box to input your initals, which will be saved to localstorage, allowing multiple players to input their initials.
